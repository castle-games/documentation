## Setting up your text editor

Castle games are written in [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)). You can use any text editor to edit your game's `.lua` files. Here are some environments that the community has found to be productive:

- **Recommended environment**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [vscode-lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trixnz.vscode-lua). We recommend this environment if you don't have an existing workflow you're familiar with.
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) with built-in Lua syntax highlighting
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with built-in Lua syntax highlighting
- [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with [lua-mode](https://github.com/immerrr/lua-mode) (available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/lua-mode))

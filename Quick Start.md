If you're looking for an in-depth guide on how to make your first Castle game, check out the [Make Your First Game](/posts/@castle/make-your-first-castle-game) tutorial. But if you just want to get up-and-running as quickly as possible, then you can follow these easy steps:

1. Download and run the [Castle Client](https://castle.games/download).
2. Log in to your Castle account (or create one if you don't already have one).
3. Click the *Create* button and follow the instructions to create your first project.
4. Open the `main.lua` file in a [text editor](/documentation/technical-reference). You'll find it in the new project you created.
5. Start making your game!

If you need any help with your game, feel free to stop by the [Castle Discord](https://discord.gg/4C7yEEC). We're always happy to help!
